Task 1: Load Testing a Web Application Using JMeter

Steps:

Download and Install JMeter:
Go to the official Apache JMeter website and download the latest version. Install it on your computer.

Open JMeter:
Launch the JMeter application. You will see the test plan window.

Create a Test Plan:
Right-click on the Test Plan → Add → Threads (Users) → Thread Group. This represents the number of virtual users you want to simulate.

Configure Thread Group:
Set the number of users (threads), ramp-up period (time to start all users), and loop count (how many times to repeat the test).

Add HTTP Request:
Right-click on the Thread Group → Add → Sampler → HTTP Request. Enter the server name or IP and the path of the web application you want to test.

Add Listeners to View Results:
Right-click on Thread Group → Add → Listener → View Results Tree / Summary Report / Aggregate Report. These will show test results and metrics.

Run the Test:
Click the green start button to run the load test.

Analyze Results:
Look at the reports and graphs to find response times, throughput, error rates, etc. Identify any delays or failures indicating performance bottlenecks.

Write Your Conclusion:
Summarize which parts of the application struggled under load and suggest possible improvements (like optimizing code, increasing server resources, etc.).
