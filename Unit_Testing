Task 1: Implement Unit Tests, Integration Tests, and End-to-End Tests for a Sample Application

Steps:

Choose Your Sample Application:
Pick a simple app (like a basic web app or calculator) that has multiple components or layers (e.g., service layer, database access, UI).

Set Up Your Testing Environment:

For Java apps, add dependencies for testing frameworks in your build tool (Maven/Gradle):

JUnit or TestNG for unit and integration tests

Selenium WebDriver for end-to-end tests

Write Unit Tests (Using JUnit or TestNG):

Focus on testing small parts like individual methods or classes.

Write tests that check if methods return expected results with different inputs.

Example: For a calculator app, test if add(2,3) returns 5.

Run your unit tests and fix any failing cases.

Write Integration Tests:

Test how multiple components work together (e.g., service layer calling database).

Use JUnit/TestNG and include setups like database connections or mock services.

Write test cases to check if combined parts give correct outputs and handle errors.

Run and verify integration tests.

Write End-to-End (E2E) Tests with Selenium:

E2E tests simulate real user actions on the appâ€™s UI (like clicking buttons, filling forms).

Set up Selenium WebDriver and configure your browser driver (ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver).

Write tests that open the app in a browser, perform user actions, and check the final result on the UI.

Example: For a login page, test if valid credentials allow access and invalid ones show an error message.

Run your Selenium tests and observe results.

Organize Your Tests:
Keep unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests in separate folders or packages for clarity.

Automate Testing:
Use build tools (Maven, Gradle) or CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to run all tests automatically on code changes.

Analyze and Report:
Review test results carefully. Document any bugs found and fix the code or tests as needed.
