1. Research and Compare Configuration Management Tools (Ansible, Puppet, Chef)

*Ansible

Language: YAML (Playbooks)

Agentless: Yes

Ease of Use: Very simple and human-readable

Best Use Case: Small to medium-scale environments, cloud automation, dynamic infrastructures

Advantages: Quick to set up, easy to learn, integrates well with CI/CD pipelines

*Puppet

Language: Puppet DSL (similar to Ruby)

Agentless: No (requires agents)

Ease of Use: Moderate complexity

Best Use Case: Large-scale environments with stable infrastructure

Advantages: Strong reporting, robust community, well-suited for enterprise environments

*Chef

Language: Ruby DSL

Agentless: Yes (with Chef client or workstation setup)

Ease of Use: Complex, especially for non-developers

Best Use Case: Complex infrastructures where custom scripting is required

Advantages: Highly customizable, strong ecosystem, good for code-driven infrastructure

2. Extend CI Pipeline to Include CD Using Jenkins and Implement Blue-Green Deployment
Steps to Implement Continuous Delivery with Blue-Green Deployment in Jenkins:

CI Setup:

Jenkins pulls code from GitHub

Builds app (Maven/pip/npm)

Runs tests automatically

Blue-Green Strategy:

Set up two environments: Blue (live) and Green (idle/test)

Jenkins deploys the new version to Green

Perform health checks on Green

If all tests pass, switch traffic from Blue to Green using a load balancer

Keep Blue as a backup (easy rollback)

Benefits:

Zero downtime

Safer deployments

Easier rollback if issues occur
