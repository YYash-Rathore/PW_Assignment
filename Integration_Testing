Task 1: Setting Up Environment for Integration Testing and Writing Test Cases

Steps:

Understand Integration Testing:
Integration testing checks if different parts (components/modules) of a system work together correctly.

Choose Your Tools:
Decide which tools or frameworks you will use for integration testing. For example, in Java, you can use JUnit with Spring Test, or in JavaScript, use Jest or Mocha.

Set Up the Environment:

Prepare your development environment with all necessary dependencies installed.

Make sure all components/services you want to test are available (e.g., databases, APIs, microservices).

Use tools like Docker to create isolated environments if needed.

Create a Test Project or Module:
In your codebase, create a dedicated folder or module for integration tests separate from unit tests.

Write Test Cases for Components Interaction:

Identify key interactions between components.

Write test cases that simulate real scenarios where these components communicate or exchange data.

For example, test if your web service correctly calls the database and returns expected results.

Mock External Dependencies (If Needed):
Use mocking tools to simulate components or services that are not available during testing (e.g., third-party APIs).

Run Integration Tests:
Execute your tests using your testing frameworkâ€™s commands or tools.

Analyze Test Results:
Check which tests pass or fail. If failures happen, debug to find whether the problem is with the interaction or the components themselves.

Document Your Tests:
Write down test case descriptions, expected results, and any bugs found during testing.
